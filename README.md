# Cryptocurrencies

* Preprocessing the Data for PCA
* Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
* Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
* Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results


The PCA statistical technique was used to reduce the dimensions to 3 components. <br>

<br>
After compiling the components, the array was used to create the Elbow curve.  This identifies that the data has 4 KMeans clusters.<br>

<br>
The 3D graph was created to visualize the 4 KMeans clusters.<br>

* Class 2 outlier principal component.
* Class 1 group is the lowest tradable cryptocurrency.
* Class 0 group is an average tradable cryptocurrency.
* Class 3 group is the higher tradable cryptocurrency. <br>
